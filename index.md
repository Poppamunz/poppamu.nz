Hello! I don't really know what to put here yet. Here's an incomplete list of various sites I'm on and my usernames on them.

- Bluesky: [@poppamu.nz](https://bsky.app/profile/poppamu.nz)
- Mastodon: <a rel="me" href="https://dftba.club/@poppamunz">@poppamunz@dftba.club</a>
- GitHub: [Poppamunz](https://github.com/Poppamunz)

(I'm not actually from New Zealand, though I hope to visit someday; as you can probably guess, this is just a domain hack. Thank you to InternetNZ for making .nz domain names available to foreigners.)
